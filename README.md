# Background
`Melbourne` is a program which takes in an input file and generates output images based on this file. The program, written in Python 3 is designed to allow users to quickly and easily create *good looking* scoreboards for online contests by simply providing an input file with information about the participants as well as the voters.

# Installation

## Python 3
`Melbourne` is written in Python 3, so you will need to have that installed on your system. Download and install the appropriate version (any version of Python 3 will do, the latest version as of 6 April 2016 was Python 3.5.1) from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

If you are installing Python 3 on Windows, don't forget to select the option to add Python to your Path; Python *will* be properly installed but you will not be able to run it without using the full path to the Python executable otherwise.
